# Image Understanding of GUI Widgets for Test Reuse

### About the Paper

- This project attempts to explains how icons, widgets, and images are labeled with meanings to help match graphical user interface (GUI) events
based on their semantic information.

- We mined relevant data from dataset RICO dataset and used models such as GLOVE and word2vec to provide foundation for semantic
matching of different events

- We concluded that the combination of semantic matching between GUI events along with widgets/icons slightly but significantly help build a better model for software test reuse
 
- We made a paper out of this project and successfully presented in IEEE Computer Society affiliated conference
 
- Later the conference paper was published in IEEE digital library
